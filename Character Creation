<b>Altered Humans:</b> Altered Humans are
everyday people like you and me (well. me,
anyway) who have been accidentally or
purposefully exposed to weird radiation,
secret formulas, or chose to be instructed
in strange and powerful talents. The
Fantastic Four, Hulk, Nick Fury, and Doctor
Strange are examples of altered humans.
• Altered humans roll their random ranks
for primary abilities on Column 1 of the
Random Ranks Table.
• After the primary ability ranks are rolled.
Altered humans may raise any single
primary ability rank by one rank.

<b>Mutants:</b> Mutants are members of the
race of Home Superior, a new race of man
born from the race of Homo Sapiens (that's
us). Mutant powers often (though not
always) first manifest themselves in the
teen-age years. Mutants are generally
feared and disliked by the populace at
large. Examples of mutants include the X-
Men, X-Factor, and New Mutants. When
creating a mutant character:
• Random ranks are rolled on Column 1 of the Random Ranks Table.
• Mutants gain one additional Power, up to the total number of Powers available to the Hero (maximum of 5).
• Resources are reduced by one rank.
• Starting Popularity is always 0.
• Mutants gain and lose Popularity at a slower rate than other character types.
• Endurance is raised by one rank.
• The majority of a mutant's Powers are inborn as opposed to equipment-based.
• They may be affected by mutant detection and mutant nullification devices.

<b>High Technology:</b> Also called Hi-Tech
Wonders, these heroes derive their abilities
solely through equipment, whether that
equipment is mystical or technological in
nature, such as Iron Man or Captain
Britain. High technology heroes start with
lower primary ability scores and in addition
may not use their powers without their
equipment; however. they receive many
other benefits.
• High technology heroes roll on column 3 of the Random Ranks Table.
• The initial Reason is raised by two ranks (If Good is rolled, then initial reason is Remarkable).
• Initial Resources are set at Good, or optionally rolled.
• High technology heroes must have at least one Contact, and they must declare what that Contact is before starting play. This Contact represents the organization that the player-character works for (or, if Resources are high enough, owns).
• At least one Talent chosen by the player must be Scientific or professional in nature.
• If, when generating Powers, the high tech wonder chooses Body Armor as a Power, the high technology hero may choose to have all his Powers combined into a battlesuit (a la Iron Man). Check 5 under the Body Armor entry for these effects. Effects are rolled on Column 6 to see how the armor affects the Fighting, Agility, Strength, and Endurance of the player-character.

<b>Robots:</b> Robots are artificially-created
sentient beings, including organic
constructs, clones, life-model decoys,
mystically-powered golems, synthezoids,
androids. and robots. Examples of such
beings include Machine Man, Vision,
Jocasta, the evil Ultron, and the robotic
form of Deathlok (the original cyborg
Deathlok is an altered human).
• Robots roll their primary abilities on column 4 of the Random Ranks Table.
• Popularity is reduced to 0 (like mutants, robots have a hard time being accepted by the populace at large). They suffer no further penalty regarding earning Popularity.
• All player-character robots may heal normally, simulating internal repair functions.
• There is no Karma loss for killing a robot or allowing a robot to be deactivated. A robot may potentially be reactivated after it has "died." A "dead" robot must be reactivated by outside forces, and will return with Karma set at 0.

<b>Aliens:</b> "Alien" is a blanket term
representing those individuals from other
civilizations. planets. dimensions or races of
man. These may include Home Mermanus
(but not Home Superior), Asgardians,
Denizens of the Dark Dimension,
Atlanteans, Olympians, Eternals, Kree,
Skrulls, and Shi'ar, as well as races that
have yet to be discovered in the Marvel
Universe. Aliens have the potential of being
incredibly powerful, but have limited
secondary abilities. The following
generation system is for super-powered
aliens whose races have not been
encountered before.
• Alien characters roll their primary abilities on column 5 of the Random Ranks Table.
• Alien powers may be natural or the result of Equipment carried. The player must declare whether any Power is inborn to his race or external.
• Aliens gain one less Power (minimum of two).
• Starting Resources are set at Poor.
• An alien character starts with one Contact (maximum). This is usually the alien's home race, dimension, or people. Those characters who do not choose the race as one of their Contacts are considered outcasts of that race, planet, or dimension (note to Judges: Outcasts are usually hunted down by others of their race).
